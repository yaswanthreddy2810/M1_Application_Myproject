## PROBLEM OF EXISTING SYSTEM

  * The main aim of this project is to reduce the traffic in the parking place. 
  * Normally we can see in the multiplexes, cinema halls, large industries, 
    and function halls there is problem they have to go and search which line is empty and which line having place to park the vehicle, 
    for parking then they need workers for parking in correct position it is the money consumed process.
  *  So to avoid this problem Car Parking System project is implemented.
  
## CHARACTERSTIC OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM
  
  * Vehicle Parking Management System is based on the concept to generate Parking Vehicle’s records & update it.  
  * Here User can add Vehicle detail (Vehicle Number) in the program and it’s not time-consuming. 
  * This System makes easy to store records of each(Arrival & Departures of vehicles). 
  * The whole project is designed in ‘C’ language and different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. 
  * This mini project is easy to operate and understand by the users. 
  * This simple mini project in C, built as a console application without using any graphics features.
